.. py:class:: ExerciseFactory(**defaults)

   Bases: :py:obj:`rest_framework.test.APIRequestFactory`


   Class that lets you create mock Request objects for use in testing.

   Usage:

   rf = RequestFactory()
   get_request = rf.get('/hello/')
   post_request = rf.post('/submit/', {'foo': 'bar'})

   Once you have a request object you can pass it to any view function,
   just as if that view had been hooked up using a URLconf.


   .. py:attribute:: base_path
      :value: '/exercises'



   .. py:attribute:: view


   .. py:method:: get_exercises()
