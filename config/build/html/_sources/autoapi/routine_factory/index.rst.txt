.. py:class:: FitnessRoutineViewFactory(**kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`rest_framework.test.APIRequestFactory`


   Class that lets you create mock Request objects for use in testing.

   Usage:

   rf = RequestFactory()
   get_request = rf.get('/hello/')
   post_request = rf.post('/submit/', {'foo': 'bar'})

   Once you have a request object you can pass it to any view function,
   just as if that view had been hooked up using a URLconf.

   .. py:method:: add_exercise(exercise)


   .. py:method:: get_view()
