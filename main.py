#
# 1.  **High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) with a focus on core exercises:** HIIT involves short bursts of intense exercise followed by brief recovery periods. Incorporating core-focused exercises like planks, Russian twists, and bicycle crunches will target abdominal muscles.
#     *   **Suggested Frequency/Duration:** 3-4 times per week for 20-30 minutes per session.
#     *   **Why it's suitable:** HIIT is effective for burning calories and reducing overall body fat, which is crucial for revealing a flatter tummy. The core exercises specifically target and strengthen abdominal muscles.
#
# 2.  **Strength Training with Compound Exercises:** Focus on exercises that work multiple muscle groups simultaneously, such as squats, deadlifts, overhead press, and rows. These exercises increase overall muscle mass, which boosts metabolism and helps burn more calories. Include targeted abdominal workouts as well.
#     *   **Suggested Frequency/Duration:** 2-3 times per week, focusing on proper form and progressive overload (gradually increasing weight/resistance).
#     *   **Why it's suitable:** Building muscle mass increases the body's resting metabolic rate, making it easier to burn fat even when at rest. Compound exercises combined with targeted core work will contribute to overall fat loss and abdominal muscle definition.
#
# 3.  **Consistent Cardiovascular Exercise:** Regular cardio, such as running, swimming, cycling, or brisk walking, helps burn calories and improve cardiovascular health.
#     *   **Suggested Frequency/Duration:** At least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity cardio per week, spread out over multiple sessions.
#     *   **Why it's suitable:** Cardiovascular exercise is essential for burning calories and reducing overall body fat. While it doesn't directly target abdominal muscles, reducing overall body fat will help reveal a flatter tummy. Combining this with the above-mentioned core exercises would enhance the results.
#
# **Important Note:** These recommendations should be combined with a healthy diet for optimal results. Prioritizing a balanced diet, including a caloric deficit, is essential for fat loss. Also, consulting with a physician or qualified fitness professional before starting any new exercise program is highly recommended."""
